##About Me

Welcome to my page!

I am a single mother of three wonderful children. I've worked for Verizon for sixteen years with twelve years in corporate training. I
specialized in training Customer Service, Technical Support, Sales and Management courses. In the last year, I decided to go back to
school and get a degree in Computer Science to follow my passion for coding. My goal is to change careers into software developing and
eventually teach others the joy of coding.
